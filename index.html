    <p>I love Books. I think they play an <strong>essentail</strong> role in helping us learn and grow. One of my favorite book is 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Habit-Being-Yourself-Create/dp/1401938094">Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza.</a>
    In the book, he shares insight on how we can improve our life with the smallest actions we are taking. 
    One of the habit he encourges everyone to implement in their life is <strong>Meditation.</strong>
    I have been practicing this in my own life lately. I can for sure see a difference in my day. I feel <strong>focused</strong> and <strong>centered</strong> through out my day.
